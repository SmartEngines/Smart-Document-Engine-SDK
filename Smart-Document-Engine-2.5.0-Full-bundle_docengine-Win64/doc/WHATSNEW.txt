# Smart Document Engine What's New

Smart Document Engine 2.5.0

New! Smart Text Engine
The Smart Document Engine continues to support arbitrary text recognition, but if you are interested in text-only recognition, we introduce a new product—Smart Text Engine.
The main advantage of Smart Text Engine is its compact size. The basic release for WASM is 2,7MB in size. Smart Text Engine provides recognition results with full geometric information, including the coordinates of individual characters.
Smart Text Engine can perform preliminary page detection to recognize template-free business documents, recognize color-inverted text (e.g., white text on a black background), and provide case-sensitive results.

* Added support for Tatar language recognition
* The text detector is now 4.6-bit and 10% faster

* Other minor fixes and improvements

Warning! Interface change in se::common library (class OcrString). Access to detailed representation of OcrString as a sequence of OcrChars (i.e. the following methods: GetChars(), GetChar(), GetMutableChar(), SetChar(), AppendChar() and C++ access to OcrChars via operator[]) now requires preliminary unpacking the internal structure using UnpackChars() method. Mutable access also requires committing changes using RepackChars() method.
